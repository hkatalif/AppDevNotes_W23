## Course Mechanics

Tight collaboration and coordination between the 2 sections	

Grading rubrics pre-determined for both sections

Tests on Tuesdays 

Tools: Teams, Lea, Mio, Moodle

Project based, group development - meetings

Visual Studio Enterprise 2019 - student access via [Azure Dev](https://azureforeducation.microsoft.com/devtools)

## Attendance

* Attendance is mandatory, even on lab days.
* Marks will be lost on your milestones/assignments if you do not attend class (missing 20% of class time for an assessment will result in a 0, per the attendance policy), unless you have sufficient reason.
* Participation will be part of your mark for group milestones.

## Plagiarism and Cheating

Why not to cheat!
* Skills development
  * You don't learn unless you struggle to figure things out for yourself
* Self-sabotage

If the material is too hard to understand, 
* ask for help early on: 
* Contact teacher. 
* Find a tutor. 

If you want to help a friend that is stuck, 
* try guiding them to think of the problems differently. 

Give yourself the time to work through roadblocks. 

## Professionalism

* Be polite at all times!
* It is ok not to like someone, it is not ok to let that change your behaviour towards them.
* Attendance (again) ... if you are not attending class, your teammates will have more work to do.
